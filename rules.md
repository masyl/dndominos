Dungeons and Dominos
====================

Introduction
------------

DnDom is a tabletop game inspired by classical DnD lore and played using a few dices and a set of standard dominoes.

It is a causal game you can learn in 15 minutes, but can be extended with additionnal special rules for more advanced players.

Each game sessions are played with 2 to 6 friend and take about 15 minutes to complete.

The rules: short version
------------------------

### Equipment

- A set of "double 6" dominoes (28 dominoes)
- 1 to 4 6-sided dices
- A token for each player (small enough to stand on half of a domino)
- Pen and paper for keeping count of the gold of each player (points)
- A table surface of about 2'by 2'

### Basic Setup


1. Find the double-blank domino and place it on the table face up. This is the spawn point and the entry to the dungeon.
2. Shuffle the remaining dominoes and place them face down on the table.
3. Each player randomly picks three dominoes to keep in their hand and hide from other players.
4. Place the blank

### The basic rules

- Exploring: The dungeon is explored (actually created) by placing dominos face up, in a grid-like pattern to create series of coridors and rooms.
- Corridors: Represented by dominoes placed contiguously is series, but never creating squares of 2 x 2 tiles
- Rooms: Created when placing a monster (a double dominos) next to another domino to create a 2 x 2 square.
- Moving: In turn, players will craw by moving their token on the tiles (two tiles by domino) as if walking down the corridors and rooms of a dungeon.
- Looting: To obtain gold, players must find and loot each of the 6 rooms that are created when placing the double dominos.
- Successful looting: You can successfully loot a room by walking on one of its tile and then throwing four dices that are each equal or higher than the four value of room's tiles.
- Failed looting: If you fail to loot the room, you player is bloodied; on his next turn, if still bloodied, a second failed attempt at looting means the player was bested in combat and his token is sent back to the spawn point; and the player can keep playing on his next turn.
- Drop: When a room is successfuly looted, the player gains the dropped gold. The amount of gold is equal to the sum of value of each tiles composing the room.
- Winning: Once the six monsters have been looted, the game ends and the player with the most points win. If a player gains enough points that looting the other rooms would not make a difference in the outcome, the game ends.

Playing the game
================

Note: Before reading the detailed rules, it is important to first read the basic rules above.

### Player turns

- On their turn, each players can make both a move and an action, in the order of their choice.
- The player can moves his token by throwing a dice and moving his token by the same number of tiles;
- Each domino is considered to be composed of two tiles.
- The player has a choice of four basic actions:
  - Explore: by placing a domino from his hand to create either a corridor or a room.
  - Loot: When inside a room, you can throw the dice to fight with the monster.
  - Fight: by throwing a dice against another player positionned on a tile next to him.
  - Rest: if bloodied, the player is healed.

### Moving accross the dungeon

- You can choose to move your hero before or after making an action.
- The main goal of moving your hero is to reach a nearby room and try to loot it.
- The number of tiles you hero will move is determined by the value of the dice throw.
- Since you cannot have two hero on the same tile, you can hop over any already occupied tile.
- When no room is available, you can also walk next to a player to attack him or position yourself wisely in order to find a room away from other players.

Actions
=======

### Exploring

The act of exploring means that a player places a domino, from his hand, on the table next to the tile on which the hero is placed.

When placing "single" dominos (two different values), you are creating a corridor. You are not permitted to place the domino in a way that would form a 2 by 2 square.

When placing the monsters "double dominos" (same value on both sides), you are creating a room. You must place it in a way that will from a 2 x 2 square. A player standing on one of the four tiles is considered to be inside the room.

A few other constraints apply when placing corridors:

- You can only place new tiles next to tiles of equal or lesser value.
- Corridors cannot be connected to a monster domino after it has been placed.

Finally, if you cannot place a tile, you can choose to exchange one of your tile for another one.



### Looting

In order to find gold by looting a room, your hero must be moved inside that room.

Looting a room is not garanteed to work, you must first win the fight agaisnt the monster in the room.

To win the fight, you must throw the dice four (4) time and score better or equal against the value of the four (4) room tiles.

For example:

- Tiles for values 1, 2, 5, 6 ... is beaten by the dice values of 2, 2, 5, 6.
- Tiles for values 3, 3, 4, 5 ... is NOT beaten by the dice values of 2, 3, 6, 6.

If not already bloodied, a failed fight means that the looting is unsuccessful and you hero is now bloodied.

But if your hero was already bloodied, he is bested in combat and is knocked out. You hero wakes up at the entrance of the dungeon on the spawn tile.

On the other hand, after a successful fight, the monster dies and drops his gold, which become your loot.

The monster domino is then flipped facing down to signify the monster has been vainquished and the room has been successfully looted.

The ammount of gold dropped is the sum value of the four tiles composing the room.

For example: two room dominos of 3:4 and 1:6 would total 14 gold coins.


### Fighting

Gold can also be obtained by winning a fight against another hero that is standing on a adjacent tile.

To attack, each player throws a dice and both values are compared.

Getting a higher value means you attack worked. Your victim drops for you an ammount of gold equal to the value of the dice.

Getting an equal value means you only made you victim trip over and they only drop (1) one gold. 

Getting a lower value means that your attack failed and nothing comes of it.

If the case that you attack with a dice value of 6 that is not parried by a 6, you victim is also left bloodied.

If already bloodied, they are knocked out. Their hero wakes up at the entrance of the dungeon on the spawn tile.

If the case that you attack with a dice value of only 1 that is not parried by a 1, you trip and fall flat on your face. Even if you had a move left, you cannot move to escape. Also, you drop a gold coin, which is picked up by your victim.

### Resting

If your hero is bloodied, the only way to gain back your health is to use an action to rest.

Even when resting, you can still move during that turn.

Note that when bloodied, you must deduct 1 points to you dice throws when moving or attacking.

Monsters
========

Each monster (the double dominos) is represented by it's vaslue:

1. Blob
2. Troll
3. Direwolf
4. Orc
5. Golem
6. Dragon

Note that this list of monster names is not very important when considering only the core rules. But this monster table is used for rule extensions that optionnaly bring more complexity into the game for more experienced players.
