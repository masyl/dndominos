The rules: short version
------------------------

### Equipment

- A set of "double 6" dominoes (28 dominoes)
- 1 to 4 6-sided dices
- A token for each player (small enough to stand on half of a domino)
- Pen and paper for score keeping
- A table surface of about 2'by 2'

### Basic Setup


1. Find the double-blank domino and place it on the table face up. This is the spawn point and the entry to the dungeon.
2. Shuffle the remaining dominoes and place them face down on the table.
3. Each player randomly picks three dominoes to keep in their hand and hide from other players.
4. Place the blank

### The basic rules

- Exploring: The dungeon is explored (actually created) by placing dominos face up, in a grid-like pattern to create series of coridors and rooms.
- Corridors: Represented by dominoes placed contiguously is series, but never creating squares of 2 x 2 tiles
- Rooms: Created when placing a monster (a double dominos) next to another domino to create a 2 x 2 square.
- Moving: In turn, players will craw by moving their token on the tiles (two tiles by domino) as if walking down the corridors and rooms of a dungeon.
- Looting: To obtain gold, players must find and loot each of the 6 rooms that are created when placing the double dominos.
- Successful looting: You can successfully loot a room by walking on one of its tile and then throwing four dices that are each equal or higher than the four value of room's tiles.
- Failed looting: If you fail to loot the room, you player is bloodied; on his next turn, if still bloodied, a second failed attempt at looting means the player was bested in combat and his token is sent back to the spawn point; and the player can keep playing on his next turn.
- Drop: When a room is successfuly looted, the player gains the dropped gold. The amount of gold is equal to the sum of value of each tiles composing the room.
- Winning: Once the six monsters have been looted, the game ends and the player with the most points win. If a player gains enough points that looting the other rooms would not make a difference in the outcome, the game ends.
