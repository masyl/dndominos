Dungeons and Dominos
====================

Introduction
------------

Dungeons and Dominos (#DnDomino) is a tabletop game inspired by DnD lore and the classic tile based role-playing games.

You can play using only a few dice and a set of "double 6" dominos that you can find in any toy store.

It is a causal game you can learn in a few rounds, but can be extended with more complexe rules for more advanced players.

Each game sessions are played with 2 to 6 friends and takes about 15 minutes to complete.

### Materials needed

- A set of "double 6" dominoes (28 dominos)
- 1 to 4 6-sided dices
- A small token for each player (small enough to stand on a domino)
- Pen and paper for keeping count of the gold coins of each hero (points)
- A table surface of about 2' by 2' to place the dominoes

The rules
---------

### Setup

1. Find the double-blank domino and place it on the table face up. This is the spawn point and the entry to the dungeon.
2. Shuffle the remaining dominoes and place them face down on the table.
3. Each player randomly picks three dominoes to keep in their hand and hide from other players.
4. Place the blank domino on the table and choose one of the two tiles as the spawn tile from which player will enter the dungeon.

### The basics

- **Exploring:** The dungeon is revealed (actually created) by placing dominos face up, in a grid-like pattern to create series of coridors and rooms.
- **Corridors:** Represented by dominoes placed contiguously is series, but never creating squares of 2 x 2 tiles
- **Rooms:** A room is created by placing a monster (a double dominos) next to other dominos to create a 2 x 2 square.
- **Moving:** In turn, players can move their token (their hero) on the dominoes, tile by tile, as if walking down the corridors and rooms of the dungeon.
- **Looting:** To obtain gold coins, players must find and loot each of the 6 rooms that are created when placing the monsters.
- **Successful looting:** You can successfully loot a room by walking inside and then fighting the monster using four dices.
- **Failed looting:** If you fail to loot the room, your player is bloodied; And on the next turn, if still bloodied, loosing a second fight means you die an must respawn.
- **Dropped gold:** When a room is successfuly looted, the monster drops his gold coins and its yours. The amount of gold coins dropped is determined by the sum value of the dominos.
- **Winning:** Once the six monsters have been vainquished, the game ends and the player with the most points win. If a player gains enough points that looting the other rooms would not make a difference in the outcome, the game ends.

### Player turns

- On their turn, each players can make both a move and an action, in the order of their choice.
- The player can moves his token by throwing a dice and moving his token by the same number of tiles;
- The player has a choice of three basic actions: Looting, Attacking and Healing.
- At the end of their turn, each player reveal another piece of the dungeon by placing a domino from his hand to create either a corridor or a room.

### Moving accross the dungeon

- Each domino is considered to be composed of two tiles.
- When moving your hero, each tile counts as one step.
- You can choose to move your hero before or after making an action.
- The main goal of moving your hero is to reach a nearby room and try to loot it.
- The maximum number of steps your hero can take is determined by the value of a dice throw.
- Your not obliged to take all the steps. But you cannot split the available steps before and after your action.
- You also have the option of not moving at all and simply pass.
- Since you cannot have two heroes on the same tile, you can hop over any occupied tile.


### Revealing the dungeon

Turn by turn, the full dungeon map is revealed by the players during the first 27 turn.

At the end of a turn, the player must place a domino from his hand on the board while respecting a few constraints:

- You can join "single" dominos (dominmos have different values) to other dominos with matching values. Meaning that you can join a 1:4 domino to a 4:3 domino by matching the 4.
- When placing "single" dominos, you are creating a corridor. You are not permitted at any moment to place a "single" domino in a way that would create a 2 by 2 square.
- When placing a "double" domino (Monsters), you are also creating a room to loot; You MUST place it in a way that will create a 2 x 2 square.
- You cannont place any domino that would create a larger room of 3x3 or 2x3. 
- Corridors cannot be connected to a monster domino that has already been killed.
- When placing a domino that will bridge two or more dominos, you only need to math the value of one other tile.
- If a domino you have in hand cannot be place anywhere, it become a joker and you can place it next to other dominos without matching the value of the tile.

Once the dungeon map is fully revealed, the rules get a few teaks to accelerate the game:

- Every dice roll when looting a room get a +1 bonus.
- Respawning rules change in favor of the respawning player.


Actions
=======

Actions are optionnal and can be used before or after moving.

There are three (3) basic actions available to all players:

  - **Looting:** When inside a room, you can throw the dice to fight with the monster.
  - **Fighting:** by throwing a dice against another player positionned on a tile next to him.
  - **Healing:** if bloodied, the player is healed.

### Looting

In order to find gold coins by looting a room, your must first move your hero inside that room by standing on one of its four (4) tiles.

Looting a room is not garanteed to succeed. You must first win the fight agaisnt the monster that was used to create the room.

To win the fight, you must throw four (4) dice and score better or equal against the value of the four (4) room tiles.

For example:

- Tiles for values 1, 2, 5, 6 ... is beaten by the dice values of 2, 2, 5, 6.
- Tiles for values 3, 3, 4, 5 ... is NOT beaten by the dice values of 2, 3, 6, 6.

If not already bloodied, a failed fight means that the looting is unsuccessful and you hero is now bloodied.

But if your hero was already bloodied, he dies and must respawn.

On the other hand, after a successful fight, the monster dies and drops his gold coins, which become your loot.

The monster domino is then flipped facing down to signify the monster has been vainquished and the room has been successfully looted.

The ammount of gold coins dropped is the sum value of the four tiles composing the room.

For example: two room dominos of 3:4 and 1:6 would total 14 gold coins.

Once there is only one room remaining to loot (1 monster to fight), the rules get a few teaks to accelerate the game:

- Players user 5 dice instead of 4 to loot the room.
- Players move with a second (2) dice.


### Attacking

Gold coins can also be obtained by attacking another hero that is standing on a adjacent tile (not considering diagonals).

The attacker first throws a dice, and the other player defends himself by also throwing a dice.

The outcome of tyhe attack is resolved as such:
- Getting a higher value means your attack worked. Your victim gets a beating and drops n quantity of gold coins equal to the value of the dice.
- Getting an equal value means your only made you victim trip over and they only drop one (1) gold coin. 
- Getting a lower value means that your attack failed and nothing comes of it.
- The attacker getting a six (6) that is not also parried by a six (6), means the victim gets a beating and bloodied.
- The attacker getting a 1 is a critical fail. You trip and fall flat on your face. The victim doesnt even need to throw a dice. Even if you had a move left, you cannot move to escape. Also, you drop one (1) gold coin that your victim picks up.

### Healing and Bloodied

When looosing in combat, you hero can become bloodied. To mark you hero s bloodied, place the token of you hero it's side.

Getting a beating while already bloodied will result in death and you must respawn.

When bloodied, your hero is partially incappacitated and you must deduct one (1) from you dice throws when moving, attacking and defending yourself.

When bloodied, using the *healing* action will bring back your hero to full health.

Using the *healing* action does not prevent you from moving.


Respawning
==========

Whenever a player dies (after getting a beating while already bloodied), it must respawn.

The respawning rules depends on wether the map has been fully revealed or not:

- If the map is still being revealed, players will respawn at the entrance of the dungeon on the first tile.
- If the map is already fully revealed, the player must throw two dice and falls on the corresponding domino.
- The player can choose to re-spawn once more if he doesnt like the new random spawn point.

The player can choose which of the two dominno tiles he will land on. If both tiles are occupied, the player can select an adjacent tile of his choice.

After respawning, the player looses any remaining move. Also, if it was his turn, the respawned player can't place a domino at the end of his turn.


Monsters
========

Monsters (the double dominos) are represented by their value:

1. Rat
2. Troll
3. Direwolf
4. Orc
5. Golem
6. Dragon

Note that this list of monster names is not very important when considering only the base rules. But this monster table becomes more important when used for rule extensions that can be added to bring more complexity into the game for the more experienced players.

Strategy: The dragon, being a "double 6" tile, is much harder to vaincquish and will often be the final boss. The value of the monsters can be stragically paired with other dominos to make a room a lot more or a lot less dangerous. Difficult rooms with high values are harder to loot, but the payoff is greater.

Edge Cases
==========

* Edge case: When too many player are at the spawn point

To clarify
==========

* examples of legal and illegal domino placement
* battle table to explain the matching of dices
* When all domnoes are placed, it a deathmatch and players dont die when bloodied
* confusing start on the spawn tile
* Deathmatch: when the dungeon map has been completely explored (all the dominos are placed).
* Pass when no moves possible


Strategies
==========

- When no room is available, you can also walk next to a player to attack them or position yourself wisely in order to place a room away from other players.
- To get goal, fighting a dragon can be more difficult than beating up other players, but they can always fight back on their next turn.
- Placing a new room always happens once your turn is over. Make sur to place them near to you, but as far as possible from other players.
